#  What is Statistics
# 
# Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data. 

#  Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used
# 
# Descriptive Statistics
# In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. 
# 
# Data is typically arranged and displayed in tables or graphs summarizing details such as histograms, pie charts, bars or scatter plots.
# 
# Descriptive Statistics are just descriptive and thus do not require normalization beyond the Data collected.
# 
# 
# Inferential Statistics
# In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data. 
# 
# Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes.
# 
# Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.
# 
# Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.

# What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of 
# each type of data
# 
# Numerical Data: Numerical data consists of numerical values and is used for quantitative analysis. It can be further divided into two subtypes:
# 
# Continuous Data: Continuous data can take any value within a specific range. It is measured, not counted, and can have infinite possible values within its range. Examples include height, weight, temperature, and time duration.
# 
# Discrete Data: Discrete data can only take specific, distinct values and is often obtained through counting. It cannot have decimal values or fractions. Examples include the number of students in a class, the number of cars in a parking lot, and the number of goals scored in a soccer match.
# 
# Categorical Data: Categorical data, also known as qualitative or nominal data, represents different categories or labels. These categories are not numerical and have no inherent order. It can be further divided into two subtypes:
# 
# Nominal Data: Nominal data has categories with no natural order or ranking. Examples include gender (male/female), colors (red, blue, green), and types of animals (dog, cat, bird).
# 
# Ordinal Data: Ordinal data has categories with a natural order or ranking. While the categories have a meaningful order, the differences between them may not be uniform. Examples include education levels (high school, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D.), rating scales (1-star to 5-star), and socioeconomic status (low, middle, high).
# 
# Text Data: Text data includes unstructured textual information and is commonly found in documents, social media posts, emails, and web pages. Analyzing and extracting insights from text data often requires natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
# 
# Example: A collection of customer reviews for a product on an e-commerce website.
# 
# Time Series Data: Time series data is a sequence of data points recorded over successive intervals of time. It is used to study trends, patterns, and seasonal variations over time.
# 
# Example: Daily stock prices of a company over the past year.
# 
# Spatial Data: Spatial data represents the geographical location and attributes of objects and features on the Earth's surface. It is commonly used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping and analysis.
# 
# Example: A map showing the population density of different regions in a country.
# 
# Image Data: Image data consists of visual representations or pictures. It is widely used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and image recognition.
# 
# Example: A dataset of images containing cats and dogs for training a machine learning model to classify animals.
# 
# Audio Data: Audio data represents sound signals and is commonly used in speech recognition, audio analysis, and music processing.
# 
# Example: A collection of audio recordings of different spoken languages for building a language recognition system.

# Grading in exam: Qualitative data
# (ii) Colour of mangoes: Qualitative data
# (iii) Height data of a class: Quantitative data 
# (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: Quantitative data 

# Nominal Level: At the nominal level, data is categorized into distinct, non-ordered categories. Nominal variables are used for labeling and identification purposes. These variables lack any inherent order or hierarchy.
# 
# Example: Eye color of a group of people (blue, brown, green).
# 
# Ordinal Level: The ordinal level involves data that can be ordered or ranked, but the differences between the categories are not uniform or precisely measurable. In other words, the relative position or rank is known, but the magnitude of the differences is not defined.
# 
# Example: Educational attainment level (elementary, high school, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D.).
# 
# Interval Level: At the interval level, data is measured on a scale where the differences between values are meaningful and can be quantified, but there is no true zero point. This means that zero does not indicate the complete absence of the characteristic being measured.
# 
# Example: Temperature in degrees Celsius. The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as the difference between 40°C and 50°C, but 0°C does not mean there is no temperature.
# 
# Ratio Level: The ratio level is similar to the interval level but with the presence of an absolute zero point, indicating a complete absence of the characteristic being measured. Ratios between values are meaningful at this level.
# 
# Example: Height in centimeters. A person with a height of 180 cm is twice as tall as someone with a height of 90 cm.
# 
# It is essential to understand the level of measurement because it dictates the appropriate statistical methods and analyses that can be applied to the data. Nominal and ordinal data often require non-parametric tests, while interval and ratio data allow for more advanced statistical techniques, including parametric tests. Additionally, the level of measurement impacts the types of graphical representations and visualizations that can be used to display the data effectively.

# Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the appropriate statistical techniques, visualizations, and interpretations that can be applied to the data. Using an incorrect statistical method or misinterpreting data based on its level of measurement can lead to erroneous conclusions and misleading insights.
# 
# Here's an example to illustrate the importance of understanding the level of measurement:
# 
# Suppose we have data on the eye colors of a group of students (blue, brown, green) and their scores in a mathematics exam. Let's examine how the level of measurement affects the analysis:
# 
# Nominal Level (Eye Color):
# If we treat eye color as a nominal variable, we can find the frequency distribution or calculate percentages of each eye color in the sample. We can use a bar chart to visualize the distribution.
# 
# Example analysis: "Among the students in the sample, 40% had blue eyes, 30% had brown eyes, and 30% had green eyes."
# 
# Ordinal Level (Mathematics Exam Grades):
# If we treat exam grades as an ordinal variable, we can analyze the distribution of grades, calculate the median score, and compare the relative rankings of the grades. However, we cannot perform meaningful arithmetic operations between the grades.
# 
# Example analysis: "The median score in the mathematics exam was a 'B,' indicating that half of the students scored above a 'B' and half below."
# 
# Interval Level (Temperature):
# Suppose we also have data on the temperatures in degrees Celsius at different locations. If we treat temperature as an interval variable, we can calculate the mean temperature, standard deviation, and perform arithmetic operations between temperatures. However, we must be cautious about interpreting ratios because the scale lacks a true zero point.
# 
# Example analysis: "The average temperature across all locations was 25°C, with a standard deviation of 3°C, indicating the variability in temperature."
# 
# Ratio Level (Height):
# Finally, let's consider height data in centimeters. If we treat height as a ratio variable, we can calculate the mean height, find the ratio between heights, and interpret the results more robustly.
# 
# Example analysis: "The average height of the students was 175 cm, with a range from 160 cm to 185 cm. One student is twice as tall as another student with a height of 90 cm."

#  the main difference between nominal data and ordinal data lies in the presence or absence of a meaningful order or ranking. Nominal data has no inherent order, while ordinal data has a meaningful ranking without precise measurement between the categories. Both types of data are categorical, and they require different analysis techniques based on their level of measurement. Nominal data typically involves non-parametric tests, while ordinal data can use both non-parametric and limited parametric tests.

# To display data in terms of range, a box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) is commonly used. A box plot is a graphical representation that provides a visual summary of the distribution of data and its range, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

# Descriptive Statistics are just descriptive and thus do not require normalization beyond the Data collected.
# 
# Inferential Statistics In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data.
# 
# Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes.
# 
# Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.
# 
# Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.

# Measures of Central Tendency:
# 
# Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. To calculate the mean, you sum all the data points and then divide by the total number of data points. The mean is sensitive to extreme values and can be affected by outliers.
# 
# Use: The mean is used to represent the typical or average value in a dataset. It provides a measure of the central location of the data.
# 
# Median: The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean.
# 
# Use: The median is useful when the data contains extreme values or is skewed, as it represents the central value that divides the data into two equal halves.
# 
# Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal).
# 
# Use: The mode is helpful in identifying the most common value in a dataset, which is particularly useful for categorical data or discrete variables.
# 
# Measures of Variability:
# 
# Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data.
# 
# Use: The range gives an idea of how spread out the data is. However, it is sensitive to extreme values and may not fully capture the variability in large datasets.
# 
# Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It measures the average squared deviation from the mean.
# 
# Use: Variance quantifies the spread of data points around the mean. It is widely used in statistical analysis and is a fundamental measure in inferential statistics.
# 
# Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation from the mean and is often preferred because it is in the same units as the original data.
